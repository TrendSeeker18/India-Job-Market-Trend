# India-Job-Market-Trend
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to analyze the Indian job market dataset to extract valuable insights about job trends, salary distributions, in-demand skills, company hiring patterns, and remote work opportunities. With a dataset containing 20,000 job listings, this project provides a comprehensive understanding of the employment landscape in India, helping job seekers, recruiters, and businesses make data-driven decisions.

Approach & Tools Used:
To uncover meaningful insights from the dataset, we employed a multi-step analytical approach using three powerful tools:

Excel – Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). This step involved handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies, and generating preliminary summary statistics.
SQL – Utilized for advanced querying, filtering, and aggregations, allowing us to extract key trends, such as the highest-paying jobs, most in-demand skills, top hiring companies, and job distributions across locations and industries.
Power BI – Used to develop a fully interactive live dashboard that visually represents the findings. With dynamic visualizations, users can filter and explore insights such as job types, salary trends by experience, and company-specific hiring data.
